## BDF Auto Test Framework - Documentation Home

This `doc` directory will contain the detailed manual for the project.  
It complements the top-level `README.md` with deeper, task-oriented guides.

### Proposed Structure

- **`overview.md`**: High-level architecture, main components, and data flow.
- **`installation.md`**: Detailed installation, environment modules, and dependencies.
- **`configuration.md`**: Full description of `config.yaml` options with examples.
- **`workflow.md`**: End-to-end workflows (full regression run, partial runs, CI usage).
- **`tests.md`**: How regression tests are organized, added, and maintained.
- **`orchestrator.md`**: CLI options (`run-input`, `run-test`, `compare`) and usage patterns.
- **`troubleshooting.md`**: Extended troubleshooting beyond `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

### Next Steps

1. Fill in each markdown file with detailed content.
2. Keep examples synchronized with the actual CLI and configuration.
3. Use this directory as the primary reference for advanced users and developers.
